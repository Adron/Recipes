# Whole Bowl

## Ingredients

**For the Tali Sauce:**

* ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
* ¼ cup water
* ¼ cup nutritional yeast (found in bins at health food stores)
* Juice of 1 lemon
* 3 garlic cloves
* ⅓ cup chickpeas (I used canned Garbanzo beans), drained
* ½ tsp mustard powder
* ¼ tsp each of: cumin, curry powder, turmeric powder, salt, garlic salt, onion salt
* ⅛ tsp cayenne pepper

**Bowl Ingredients:**

* 4 cups cooked brown rice (1 cup per bowl)
* 1 can (15 oz.) black beans (1/4 can per bowl)
* ½ cup salsa or pico de gallo (about 2 tablespoons per bowl)
* ¼ cup black olives, roughly chopped (1 Tbs per bowl)
* 1 avocado, sliced (1/4 avocado per bowl)
* ½-1 cup sharp cheddar, shredded (2 Tbs per bowl)
* ¼ cup sour cream (1 Tbs per bowl)
* ¼ cup cilantro, fresh, chopped (1 generous pinch per bowl.)
* Tali Sauce (1/4 cup per bowl)

**Instructions:**

For the sauce: measure out all ingredients and put in a food processor or blender and blend until silky smooth. If you want yours to be more liquidy, add additional tablespoon by tablespoon of water until desired consistency is reached. The sauce makes enough for 4 bowls, so store in the fridge in an airtight container for up to a week if not using all immediately (I've also frozen it and let it thaw before serving, it is also good microwaved and served warm.)

Bowl Assembly: In the bottom of a bowl place brown rice and beans, then salsa, then ½ the amount of Tali Sauce, then the the cheddar, olives, and on the sides the sour cream and remaining Tali Sauce, and top of with cilantro...yum!
